## FOREST

>Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy
>cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not
>include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use. 

### Explanatory notes

1. Forest is determined both by the presence of trees and the absence of other predominant
land uses. The trees should be able to reach a minimum height of 5 meters.
2. Includes areas with young trees that have not yet reached but which are expected to reach
a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of 5 meters or more. It also includes
areas that are temporarily unstocked due to clear-cutting as part of a forest management
practice or natural disasters, and which are expected to be regenerated within 5 years.
Local conditions may, in exceptional cases, justify that a longer time frame is used.
3. Includes forest roads, firebreaks and other small open areas; forest in national parks,
nature reserves and other protected areas such as those of specific environmental,
scientific, historical, cultural or spiritual interest.
4. Includes windbreaks, shelterbelts and corridors of trees with an area of more than 0.5 hectares
and width of more than 20 meters.
5. Includes abandoned shifting cultivation land with a regeneration of trees that have, or
are expected to reach, a canopy cover of at least 10 percent and tree height of at least
5 meters.
6. Includes areas with mangroves in tidal zones, regardless whether this area is classified
as land area or not.
7. Includes rubberwood, cork oak and Christmas tree plantations.
8. Includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover
criteria are met.
9. Excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems, such as fruit tree plantations, oil
palm plantations, olive orchards and agroforestry systems when crops are grown under
tree cover. Note: Some agroforestry systems such as the “Taungya” system where crops
are grown only during the first years of the forest rotation should be classified as forest.

## OTHER WOODED LAND

>Land not defined as “Forest”, spanning more than 0.5 hectares; with trees higher than
>5 meters and a canopy cover of 5-10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds; or
>with a combined cover of shrubs, bushes and trees above 10 percent. It does not include
>land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use.

### Explanatory notes
1. The definition above has two options:
•	 The canopy cover of trees is between 5 and 10 percent; trees should be higher than
5 meters or able to reach 5 meters.
or
•	 The canopy cover of trees is less than 5 percent but the combined cover of shrubs,
bushes and trees is more than 10 percent. Includes areas of shrubs and bushes where
no trees are present.
2. Includes areas with trees that will not reach a height of at least 5 meters and with a
canopy cover of 10 percent or more, e.g. some alpine tree vegetation types, arid zone
mangroves, etc.
3. Includes areas with bamboo and palms provided that land use, height and canopy cover
criteria are met.

## OTHER LAND
>All land that is not classified as forest or other wooded land.
>Explanatory notes

4. Includes agricultural land, meadows and pastures, built-up areas, barren land, land under
permanent ice, etc.
5. Includes all areas classified under the sub-category “Other land with tree cover”.
